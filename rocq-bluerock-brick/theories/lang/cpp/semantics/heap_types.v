(** Heap types (aka 'runtime types') are the subset of types
    that are known at runtime.

    Because <<const>>ness and <<volatile>>ness are reflected
    using separation logic principles, qualifiers are not preserved
    in runtime types.

    Additionally, types such as [Tincomplete_array] are not runtime
    types, they are static approximations of the single runtime type
    of arrays, i.e. [Tarray].
