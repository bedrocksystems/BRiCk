The tactic [destruct_tele] projects bound variables out of every
[tele_arg] in the Coq context, enabling telescopic function
applications to reduce. The variant [destruct_tele/=] follows this
with [cbn in *] to simplify away, e.g., any lingering [tele_app]s.

THIS CODE IS DEPRECATED: The need for this tactic arose from the
inductive representation of [tele_arg] which stdpp previously used.
The current fixpoint representation needs no extra [destruct]s to
reduce [tele_app]s.
