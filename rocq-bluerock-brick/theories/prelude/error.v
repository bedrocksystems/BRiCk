(** ** Errors *)
(**
Unmatchable errors to aid debugging. To use this type, write the
following:

<<
  mlock Definition error_name ...error arguments... : Error.t := inhabitant.
>>

Often, it is best to define an error as close to its use site as
possible so that it is easy to search/grep for.

Note: there is minimal maintence cost to declaring new errors, so
verbose errors can be good.

Module Type ERROR.
  Parameter t : Set.
  #[global] Declare Instance exc : Inhabited t.
End ERROR.

Module Error : ERROR.
  Definition t := unit.
  Definition exc : Inhabited t := _.
End Error.
