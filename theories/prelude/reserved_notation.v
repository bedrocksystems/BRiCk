(** ** Iris big ops *)
(**
 * We stick with the levels and associativity used in Iris' big ops
 * notation. Compared to that notation, we:
 *
 * - add an optional break and indentation after binders
 * (significantly improving readability)
 *
 * - use [**], [/\], [\/], [ |-> ] instead of [∗], [∧], [∨], [↦]
 * (slightly improving typeability)
 *
 * TODO: Upstream the formatting box changes.
