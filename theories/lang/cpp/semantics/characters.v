(** Architecture independent character values

    To unify the *value* representation of characters, we store characters
    in an architecture-independent way as [unsigned] integers (using [N]).

    Effectively, this is like storing values of type `char` as if they were
    `unsigned char` and re-interpreting the bits as `signed char` before
    performing operations on them. Note that because this is a logical-only
    conversion, it does not require a boundedness check, i.e. for 8-bit
    characters, 255 should mean -1 on a signed platform *regardless* of the
    C++ language version.

    The conversion from this representation to its integral representation
    is typed *on both sides* meaning that you need both the source and the
    target type information in order to perfom the conversion.

    The low-level conversion functions are included here to fully document
    the representation. [conv_int] abstracts these details for use in the
    rest of the semantics.
