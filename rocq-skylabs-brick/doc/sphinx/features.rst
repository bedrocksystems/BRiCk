Language Support
#################

The |project| program logic is aimed to be a formalization of pragmatic C++. Its feature set is guided by the requirements of low-level program verification and also some pragmatic considerations.

Status
======

This page describes |project| and ``cpp2v`` as of October 2026. Each entry links to its tracking issue where one exists. The
:file:`CHANGES.md` file at the repository root lists breaking changes.

A C++ construct that |project| does not fully support falls into one of the
following categories, from most to least disruptive:

Rejected by ``cpp2v``
  ``cpp2v`` stops with a fatal error. No part of the translation unit can be
  verified.

Unsupported declaration
  ``cpp2v`` emits ``Dunsupported`` for a type and continues. Functions whose
  code needs that type cannot be verified; other functions in the
  translation unit are unaffected.

Unsupported syntax
  ``cpp2v`` emits ``Eunsupported``, ``Sunsupported``, ``Tunsupported``, or
  ``Bunsupported``. These have no semantics: a proof that reaches one gets
  stuck.

No semantics
  ``cpp2v`` translates the construct faithfully, but the program logic has no
  rule for it. A proof that reaches it gets stuck.

Partial
  The program logic covers the construct, but not all of its behaviors, or
  covers it with a documented restriction.

``skylabs.lang.cpp.syntax.supported`` checks a translation unit for many of
these constructs.

   * - Exceptions: :cpp:`throw`, :cpp:`try`, :cpp:`typeid`, dynamic exception
       specifications
     - Unsupported syntax

   * - Lifetime-extended temporaries, e.g. :cpp:`const T& x = f();` or
       :cpp:`std::initializer_list<int> il = {1, 2, 3};`
     - Unsupported syntax
     - These require scope-extruded temporaries.
       `BRiCk#272 <https://github.com/SkyLabsAI/BRiCk/issues/272>`_

     - *Calling* variadic functions, e.g. :cpp:`printf`, is supported.
   * - GNU statement expressions (``({ ... })``)
     - No semantics
     -
   * - :cpp:`offsetof`
     - No semantics

     -
   * - :cpp:`reinterpret_cast`
     - No semantics
     - `BRiCk#156 <https://github.com/SkyLabsAI/BRiCk/issues/156>`_
   * - Member pointer operators (:cpp:`.*`, :cpp:`->*`) and calls through
       member function pointers
     - No semantics
     - Member pointer *types* have a layout, and null member pointers can be
       created. Default-initializing a member pointer is an error.
   * - Explicitly defaulted constructors and methods that ``cpp2v`` does not
       elaborate
     - No semantics
     - Implicit and defaulted members that Clang elaborates are supported.
   * - Initializing members of anonymous structs or unions in a constructor
       initializer list; indirect or self initialization of unions

     -
   * - Destroying :cpp:`operator delete`
     - No semantics
     -
   * - Default arguments of reference type
     - No semantics
     - `BRiCk#390 <https://github.com/SkyLabsAI/BRiCk/issues/390>`_
   * - Function-local :cpp:`static` variables
     - Partial
     - The rules for the initialization guard exist, but nothing provides the
       initial ``static_initialized`` ownership, so first use gets stuck.
   * - Changing the active member of a :cpp:`union`
     - Partial
     - The ``union_change`` rule is disabled pending a sound formulation as
       part of assignment. Implicit union copies translate to an empty body.
       `BRiCk#345 <https://github.com/SkyLabsAI/BRiCk/issues/345>`_
   * - Implicit copy assignment of byte arrays
     - Partial
     - Gets stuck at :cpp:`__builtin_memcpy`. `BRiCk#369 <https://github.com/SkyLabsAI/BRiCk/issues/369>`_
   * - Zero-initialization
     - Partial
     - Only trivial cases are supported. `BRiCk#135 <https://github.com/SkyLabsAI/BRiCk/issues/135>`_
   * - :cpp:`volatile`
     - Partial
     - :cpp:`volatile` qualifiers are ignored. Default-initialization of a
       :cpp:`volatile` object is unsupported.
   * - :cpp:`switch`
     - Partial
     - Mixing :cpp:`switch` with other control flow (e.g. Duff's device) is
       not supported.
   * - Atomics
     - Partial
     - All atomic accesses must be sequentially consistent [#weak-mem]_.
       Compare-exchange is supported on integers, not pointers.
   * - :cpp:`template` code
     - Partial
     - Templates can only be reasoned about *after* instantiation to specific
       arguments.
   * - Translation unit initialization (initialization of globals)
     - Partial
     - Not covered by the program logic.
   * - Flexible array members, `transparent replacement
       <https://eel.is/c++draft/basic.life#8>`_
     - Not supported
     - Flexible array members are not standard C++ but are common in
       practice.

Floating point arithmetic and comparisons are supported for IEEE-754 formats
(half, single, double, and quad precision), with semantics given by Flocq.
x87 :cpp:`long double` values are abstract.

Soundness Caveats
=================

The following are known ways in which a proof can be weaker than it appears.

* **Exceptions.** Function calls are assumed not to throw.
* **Member functions** are modeled as functions. Exploiting this requires
  :cpp:`reinterpret_cast`.
* **Defaulted functions.** |project| relies on the semantics of defaulted
  functions (default constructors, assignment operators, etc.) as generated by
  Clang. A different compiler may generate different, still correct, code
  that invalidates your proof. Use Clang *with exactly the same build
  parameters as your build*.
* **Internal linkage.** Top-level :cpp:`static` declarations and anonymous
  namespaces are currently treated unsoundly.
  `BRiCk#364 <https://github.com/SkyLabsAI/BRiCk/issues/364>`_
* **Alignment** obligations are not checked when introducing a typed
  points-to (``tptsto``).
  `BRiCk#354 <https://github.com/SkyLabsAI/BRiCk/issues/354>`_
* ``tptsto_agree`` is not sound in the ``simple_pred`` model.
  `BRiCk#232 <https://github.com/SkyLabsAI/BRiCk/issues/232>`_
* **delete.** :cpp:`delete` of a null pointer is modeled as calling the
  deallocation function with size 0, and :cpp:`::delete p` may use a
  class-specific :cpp:`operator delete`.
  `BRiCk#388 <https://github.com/SkyLabsAI/BRiCk/pull/388>`_
* **Anonymous declarations.** Anonymous declarations in separate fragments of
  a reopened namespace can receive the same name, so one can overwrite the
  other's metadata.
  `BRiCk#383 <https://github.com/SkyLabsAI/BRiCk/pull/383>`_
* **Zero-sized globals.** Distinct globals are assumed to have distinct
  addresses, which does not hold for zero-sized objects (a compiler
  extension). `BRiCk#373 <https://github.com/SkyLabsAI/BRiCk/pull/373>`_
* **Incomplete extern globals** provide ``reference_to`` for their declared
  type even though their alignment is unknown.
  `BRiCk#380 <https://github.com/SkyLabsAI/BRiCk/pull/380>`_

Other open soundness fixes carry the ``soundness`` label.

Trusted Base
------------

The program logic is stated axiomatically: ``rocq-skylabs-brick/theories``
contains about 450 ``Axiom`` declarations. The models under
``theories/lang/cpp/model`` currently contain 8 ``Admitted`` lemmas
(``simple_pred.v``, ``inductive_pointers.v``, ``inductive_pointers2.v``).

Deviations from the Standard
============================

In certain instances, |project|'s semantics deviates from the C++ standard.

* |project|'s semantics do not currently permit "pointer zapping". See :ref:`no-pointer-zapping`.
* |project| uses `Tnum sz sgn` to represent all integer types rather than the standard types :cpp:`char`, :cpp:`short`, :cpp:`int`, :cpp:`long`, :cpp:`long long`.
* |project| is based on the Clang front-end IR. We believe that this is a reasonable proxy for source-level C++.
* The |project| program logic *assumes* that the abstract syntax tree is well-typed and uses this assumption to avoid performing type checking within the semantics. If you are using `cpp2v` to generate the AST, then Clang will ensure that the syntax tree is well typed.

Toolchain Requirements
======================

* ``cpp2v`` requires LLVM 16 or later. CI tests LLVM 20 through 22; other
  versions are untested. The release images use LLVM 22.
* Generate the AST with the same Clang flags as your build (see
  *Defaulted functions* above).

Extensions to the Standard
===========================

|project| also extends the C++ standard in limited ways to make low-level program verification possible.
For example, inter-operation with assembly (see :ref:`machine-interop`), sharing data across address spaces, etc.
We believe that our extensions are conservative and characterize the way that low-level programmers rely on compilers to work.

.. [#weak-mem] We plan to support weak memory C++ in the future based on other work in Iris.
